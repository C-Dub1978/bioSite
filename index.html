              <blockquote>One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant
                of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too
                weird to live, and too rare to die.<br>
                - Hunter S. Thompson
              </blockquote>

            </p>
            <p>Hailing from a small town in Texas, J.P. started rock climbing
              and wakeboarding at a very young age. He also took up snowboarding.
              It was clear that he enjoyed taking moderate risks and focusing on
              nothing in life except having as much fun as possible, all day
              e'rrrry day. He has had a thirst for life since birth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward to his '20s, and J.P. decided it was time to up the
              game, so he signed up for what's known as 'Accelerated freefall',
              or AFF for short. This is the program where you learn how to
              skydive. After about 8 jumps with instructors by your side, they
              turn you loose into the sky on your own and let you do your solo
              jumps until you reach jump number 25, at which point you go up and
              do a final check dive with an instructor. You do a series of
              maneuvers and if you perform all of them, in a safe manner, you
              earn yourself a USPA 'A' license, which means you are a big bad
              skydiver and can jump with your own gear, with other people, at
              any dropzone in the world.
